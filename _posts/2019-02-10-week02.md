describe your own contributions to your team's efforts of building your browser extension.
I am at the moment attempting to learn some javascript.  However, my coding skills are lacking so this may take a while...


describe the state of your browser extension project: what progress your team make, what problems you encountered, will you have a working product by the due date
Some of the problems in this project is communication. We haven't really discussed our project fully with other team members. Currently, we are trying to develop an extension that blocks certain webpages for a certain amount of time.  I have no idea when the product will be finished by.

describe at least one thing about git or gitHub that you learned this week (something that was new to you)
I learned how to clone files on github.
